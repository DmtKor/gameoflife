Simple Game Of Life realization. 
Space here is torus-like (highest cell <-> lowest cell, cell on right border <-> cell on left border).

Compilation: make all (requires sfml)
Executable in /build


Controls: 

[SPACE] - pause/continue

[LMOUSE] - add cell
[RMOUSE] - remove cell
[BACKSPACE] - erase all

[ARROW UP] - faster
[ARROW DOWN] - slower

Enjoy, lol.
